    <h3>DevOps Engineer</h3>

<h5>The Company</h5><br />
<p>We are a small tech start-up which is trying to move the technology industry towards lower-cost IT systems. We are in the final stages of building our own porta-cloud offering. We don't believe in trapping customers into one cloud or another, and we also don't believe that cloud should be something big and different, so for our systems cloud is hidden under the hood and companies can work seemlessly on the same system which might straddle on-premise and in-cloud with expensive operations happening on-premise to reduce costs. The same cloud technology we use for our own systems will one day be available to all customers, so whether they want a hosted cloud solution or an on-premise cloud-like microservice capability we have the right system for them.</p>

<h5>The Role</h5>
As a dev-ops engineer your role will be to help us get our deployment and hosting systems running as we want it.
You will be setting up our docker/kubernetes environment for 3 modes - standalone application, on-premise, SAAS-style Design With Wisdom-hosted cloud offering per customer, and customer-led cloud deployment (and hybrids of these options).
Creating deployment scripts
Ensuring that security standards are met throughout all processes and systems
Adding any functionality to eCompete that might be required to support the hosting, configuration and deployment of cloud-based systems
Suggesting improvements and additional functionality that we may not have which might be helpful for customers hosting their applications on our systems
