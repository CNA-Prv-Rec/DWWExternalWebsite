## Project Overview

This is a very old copy of my external website, when I had my company site. It cost Â£78 per month to run in Azure so I don't bother to host it any more. Planned to upgrade it to react/AWS to cut costs but never got round to it because I spent most of my time learning new frameworks instead.

Written in .Net / C# / MVC. Recently upgraded to .Net 9, should probably spend a bit of time looking at changes and updating to be in line with new .Net developments.
